* Documentation
** Write a complete User Guide.
** Write a complete Developer Guide.
** Create FAQ

* Testing
** Test that each possible option from ReleaseInfo is used correctly in every context (Installers, Distributors...)
** Test checkTools on ReleaseInfo, Installers and Distributors
** Test that including Ruby in exe effectively works in an environment not having Ruby

* Development
** Make it run under MacOS
** Make rdoc modifications part of a real Gem or an RDoc improvement.
** Use RDI in checkContext methods.
** As it is possible to have many failures when delivering or generating installers, and as generating executables and documentation is a long process, it should be better to reuse partially generated content.
